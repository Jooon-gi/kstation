### 🔹 MENNUS PLUS (PLA 360mg x 1 Vial)
- **Efficacy**: Provides instant volume through its CMC gel component and long-term volume by stimulating the body's natural collagen production with PLA microparticles. It effectively treats deep wrinkles and helps restore firmness and elasticity.
- **Duration**: The initial effect of instant volume lasts approximately 3-9 months. The secondary effect from collagen regeneration provides a lasting result for 18-24 months.
- **Treatment Area**: Face, including cheeks, chin, temporal area, and nasolabial folds. Also suitable for the neck, decollete, and hands.
- **Usage**: Requires reconstitution with sterile distilled water and can be mixed with lidocaine. The product is then injected into the target areas. Post-treatment massage is recommended.
- **Additional Information**: Unlike temporary fillers, this biostimulator works by encouraging the body to produce its own collagen, leading to a natural and gradual improvement. The spherical PLA particles are designed to allow for easy injection without needle blockage and to create an even, stable volume.
