## 6. Detailed Description of MENNUS (PLA 200mg x 1 Vial)

### 🔹 MENNUS (PLA 200mg x 1 Vial)
- **Efficacy**: Gradually improves wrinkles and restores facial volume by promoting collagen synthesis. The effect is twofold: immediate volume from the CMC component and long-term collagen regeneration from the PLA particles.
- **Duration**: The total effect can last for 18-24 months. Initial volume lasts for 3-9 months, followed by a secondary, long-lasting effect from collagen regeneration.
- **Treatment Area**: The entire facial area, with the exception of the glabella and eye region. It is used to address deep wrinkles on the forehead, correct deep nasolabial folds, and augment temporal and cheekbone areas.
- **Usage**: The product is reconstituted with sterile distilled water and can be mixed with a local anesthetic before injection into the deep dermis or subcutaneous layer.
- **Additional Information**: MENNUS utilizes freeze-drying technology to reduce reconstitution time. Its spherical PLA particles and low injection pressure ensure a smoother, more convenient administration compared to other PLA fillers. The biodegradable materials are naturally degraded by the body, leaving no residue.
